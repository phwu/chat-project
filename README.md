## This is a small project that implements a chat session between clients using socket.io.
It features server side and client side code. Multiple clients can connect to the server. Currently, the messages are persisted directly to Mongo but it would be a good idea to implement Mongoose so that the data is neat. :)

To run the code:
1. pull repo
2. start the server "app.js" using node (node app.js)
3. access local host at port 3000 (1 client)
4. magic
